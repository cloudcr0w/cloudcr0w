# Hi there, I'm Adam ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm an aspiring **Cloud Engineer** with a passion for **AWS** and cloud technologies. I have recently earned my **AWS Cloud Practitioner certification** and am currently preparing for the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate** exam. I am also developing skills in **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Linux**. After 17 years of experience in logistics and production, I bring strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and experience managing complex processes with tools like **SAP**.

## Skills:
- **AWS**: EC2, S3, IAM, RDS, CloudFront, Route53
- **Automation**: Docker, Kubernetes ( still learning )
- **Operating Systems**: Basic knowledge of Linux and Windows

## Projects:
Here are some of the projects I've worked on to strengthen my cloud skills:

### 1. Multi-Tier Web Application on AWS 
- AWS EC2: Hosting the backend server.
- AWS S3: Storing static assets (HTML, CSS, JS) for the frontend.
- AWS CloudFront: Content Delivery Network (CDN) for faster access and improved performance.
- AWS RDS (MySQL): Managed relational database service for storing user messages.
- Node.js & Express: Backend API to handle form submissions and communicate with the database.
- MySQL: Used for data storage in AWS RDS.
- CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for handling requests from the frontend.
- SSL (Let's Encrypt): Secure communication over HTTPS.
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Frontend technologies to build a responsive and interactive user interface.

Currently under development! :hammer_and_wrench: 
- **AWS Amplify**: Streamlines the setup (Auth, Storage, API) and handles frontend hosting and CI/CD.  
- **Amazon Cognito**: Provides user registration, login, and access management to resources (S3, DynamoDB).  
- **Amazon S3**: Stores image files and triggers a Lambda function upon new uploads.  
- **AWS Lambda**: Connects to AWS Rekognition and DynamoDB to automate image tagging.  
- **AWS Rekognition**: Analyzes images and returns recognized labels (tags).  
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Stores image data and tags in a NoSQL database.  
- **AWS AppSync (GraphQL)**: Offers an API for frontend-backend communication; Amplify generates the necessary schema and DynamoDB resources.
