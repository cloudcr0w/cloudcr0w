![Visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=cloudcr0w.cloudcr0w)

🇵🇱 [Zobacz wersję po polsku](./README.pl.md)

I'm a career switcher with 17 years of experience in process optimization and logistics – including over 8 years of hands-on SAP MM/WM usage in a heavy industry environment.  
Now, I build **secure, automated, and observable cloud infrastructure** ☁️🚀

I'm looking for my **first professional role in DevOps or Cloud Engineering** — ready to contribute from day one with real project experience, strong AWS skills, and relentless motivation.

## 🌍 My Background in SAP & Logistics

Before transitioning to cloud engineering, I worked in production and logistics, where I:

- Used **SAP MM/WM daily** to manage inventory, procurement, and warehouse operations
- Collaborated with IT teams during system changes and SAP integrations
- Gained real-world insights into **enterprise systems and business-critical workflows**

I bring this **practical SAP + business process knowledge** into my cloud projects — ideal for companies using or migrating SAP to AWS.

## 🧭 What I Focus On

- ✅ Building full cloud-native architectures (frontend, backend, IaC, CI/CD)
- 🔐 Embedding DevSecOps principles early (IAM, GuardDuty, monitoring)
- ☁️ Leveraging AWS the right way – scalable, secure, and event-driven
- 🔧 Automating everything: deployments, alerts, security, observability
- 📈 Making systems trackable with CloudWatch metrics and dashboards
