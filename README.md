I'm a career switcher with 17 years of experience in process optimization and logistics – including 8+ years hands-on with **SAP MM/WM** in heavy industry.  
Now, I build **secure, automated, and observable cloud infrastructure** ☁️🚀

🎯 Actively looking for my **first professional DevOps / Cloud Engineering role**.  
💡 Backed by real-world AWS projects, IaC practice, and relentless curiosity.

## ⚙️ Skills at a Glance

- ☁️ **Cloud**: AWS (Lambda, S3, EC2, RDS, Route 53, CloudWatch, IAM, Config, GuardDuty, EventBridge)
- 📦 **IaC**: Terraform (actively learning), CloudFormation
- 🔁 **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- 🔐 **Security**: IAM, WAF, SSL, least privilege, audit logging
- 🐳 **Containers**: Docker, Kubernetes (basics)
- 🧠 **Code**: Python (REST APIs), Bash, Node.js (Express)

## 🧭 Enterprise Roots in SAP & Logistics

Before tech, I worked in production/logistics where I:

- Used **SAP MM/WM daily** for procurement, inventory, warehouse ops
- Partnered with IT during system upgrades & SAP integrations
- Built strong foundations in **enterprise processes and reliability**

I bring this mindset into cloud — ideal for teams migrating SAP or optimizing backend operations.
