I’m a **career switcher** with 17 years in process optimization & logistics (8+ years with **SAP MM/WM** in heavy industry).  
Now I design **secure, automated, and observable cloud infrastructure** ☁️🚀

🎯 Actively looking for my **first professional DevOps / SRE role**.  
💡 Backed by hands-on AWS projects, IaC pipelines, and relentless curiosity.

## ⚙️ Skills at a Glance

- ☁️ **Cloud**: AWS (Lambda, S3, EC2, RDS, Route 53, CloudWatch, IAM, Config, GuardDuty, EventBridge)  
- 📦 **IaC**: Terraform (in progress), CloudFormation  
- 🔁 **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions  
- 🐳 **Containers**: Docker, Kubernetes (basics)  
- 🔐 **Security**: IAM, WAF, SSL, least privilege, audit logging  
- 📊 **Monitoring & Observability**: CloudWatch, dashboards, alerting (Grafana/Prometheus basics)  
- 🧠 **Code**: Python (REST APIs), Bash, Node.js (Express)

## 🧭 Enterprise Roots in SAP & Logistics

Before tech, I worked in production/logistics where I:  

- Used **SAP MM/WM daily** for procurement, inventory, warehouse ops  
- Partnered with IT during system upgrades & SAP integrations  
- Built a foundation in **enterprise reliability and process discipline**  

I bring this mindset into cloud — ideal for teams migrating SAP or optimizing backend operations.
