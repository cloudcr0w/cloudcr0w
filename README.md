# 👋 Hi, I'm Adam Wrona

**Junior Cloud / DevOps / Application Support Engineer**  
Focused on AWS, troubleshooting, incident resolution and building stable, production-like environments.

I combine **hands-on cloud & DevOps projects** with a **strong application support background** gained in enterprise systems used in production environments.

## 🔍 What I’m currently looking for

I’m actively looking for **entry-level / junior roles**, especially:

- **Junior DevOps Engineer**
- **Cloud / Application Support Engineer**
- **Junior SRE / Platform Support**
- **SAP Application Support (MM / general support roles)**

I’m open to both **cloud-oriented** and **SAP support-oriented** paths, depending on the team and project.

## 🧠 What I bring

- ☁️ **Cloud & DevOps fundamentals**  
  AWS services, CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code, automation mindset

- 🔍 **Application support & troubleshooting**  
  Log analysis, incident handling, root cause analysis, API & integration debugging

- 📊 **Monitoring & observability**  
  Dashboards, metrics and alerts using Grafana, Prometheus and CloudWatch

- 🏭 **Enterprise systems background (SAP MM)**  
  Years of working with SAP as a core production system, supporting business users under real operational pressure

## 🏭 SAP background (enterprise systems)

Before moving deeper into cloud and DevOps roles, I spent many years working in **production and logistics environments** where **SAP (MM)** was a critical operational system.

This experience helped me build a strong **application support mindset**:
- supporting business users under production pressure,
- analyzing incidents impacting critical processes,
- understanding how IT systems affect real-world operations,
- acting as a bridge between technical teams and non-technical users.

I treat this background as a solid foundation for **application support, cloud support and SAP support roles**.
